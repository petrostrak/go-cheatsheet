The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR),
 was a transcontinental country that spanned much of Eurasia from 1922 to 1991. 
 A flagship communist state, it was nominally a federal union of fifteen republics;
in practice, both its government and its economy were highly centralized until 
its final years. It was a one-party state governed by the Communist Party of 
the Soviet Union, with the city of Moscow serving as its capital as well as 
that of its largest and most populous republic, the Russian SFSR. Other major 
cities included Leningrad (Russian SFSR), Kiev (Ukrainian SSR), Minsk (Byelorussian SSR), 
Tashkent (Uzbek SSR), Alma-Ata (Kazakh SSR), and Novosibirsk (Russian SFSR). 
It was the largest country in the world by land area, covering over 22,402,200 
square kilometres (8,649,500 square miles) and spanning eleven time zones.

The country's roots lay in the October Revolution of 1917, when the Bolsheviks, 
under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the Russian Provisional Government 
that had earlier replaced the House of Romanov of the Russian Empire. The Bolshevik 
victory established the Russian Soviet Republic, the world's first constitutionally 
guaranteed socialist state.[r] Persisting internal tensions escalated into the Russian 
Civil War. By 1922, the Bolsheviks under Vladimir Lenin had emerged victorious, 
forming the Soviet Union.
