### Mutex
Mutex stands for "mutual exclusion" and is a way to guard `critical sections` of the program. A Mutex provides a concurrent-safe way to express exclusive access to these shared resources. A Mutex shares memory by creating a conventions developers must follow to synchronize access to the memory.
