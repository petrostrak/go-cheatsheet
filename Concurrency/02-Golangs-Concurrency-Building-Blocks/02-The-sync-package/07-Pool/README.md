### Pool
Pool is a concurrent-safe implementation of the object pool pattern. At a high level, the pool pattern is a way to create and make available a fixed number, or pool, of things for use. It's commonly used to constrain the creation of things that are expensive (e.g. DB connections) so that only a fixed number of them are ever created, but an indeterminate number of operations can still request access to these things. In the case of Go's `sync.Pool`, this data type can be safely used by multiple goroutines.

Pool's primary interface is its `Get` method. When called, Get will first check whether there are any available instances within the pool to return to the caller, and if not, call its `New` member variable to create a new one. When finished, callers call `Put` to place the instance they were working with back in the pool for use by other precesses.
