### Concurrency in Go

This repo demonstrates best practices and patterns to help you incorporate concurrency into your systems. More specifically, it will help you:

* Understand who Go addresses fundamental problems that make concurrency difficult to do correctly.
* Learn the key differences between concurrency and parallelism.
* Dig into the syntax of Go's memory synchronization primitives.
* Form patterns with these primitives to write maintainable concurrent code.
* Compose patterns into a series of practices that enable you to write large, distributed systems that scale.
* Learn the sophistication behind goroutines and how Go's runtime stitches everything together.
